"""A tool that adds marks to scored log files based on a ``LIGHTS ON`` behavior

The marks are added with negative time and frame so as to accurately record
when, relative to the start of the scored log file, the lights were recorded
coming on.

When called directly, this script assumes that the log files are present in the
current directory (``.``). Files are partitioned such that each partition holds
the logs for one fish on one day. Afternoon files are ignored, and the
``LIGHTS_ON`` behavior in the ``_1`` or ``_2`` logs is transferred to the
``_Morning`` log.

WARNING: This script is NOT general. It is specific to one particular
    experiment. It may, however, be a useful example for other researchers.
