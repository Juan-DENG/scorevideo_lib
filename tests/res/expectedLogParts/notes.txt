Male quivers/laterally displays at the beginning, but the first part of the behavior is cut off, so it is not scored
While difficult to compare FM and SM sizes directly, I think the non-dominant male in this tank is actually larger (FM)
0:56.30 Here it is apparent that colorless male is FM
19:21.77 SM digging
14:19.50 SM digging
26:00.23 SM digging
