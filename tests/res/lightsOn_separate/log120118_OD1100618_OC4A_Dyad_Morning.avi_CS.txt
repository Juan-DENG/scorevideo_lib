NOTES
------------------------------------------
At 1:17:17 FM twitches unusually near SF as he swims into pot.
At 4:21.87 FM, while in pot, suddenly flips around
At 9:31.67, FM chases SM. During FM's approach, he seems to quiver. I'm not sure what this is called.
By 12:13.23, SM has lost eye-bar
At 12:11.57, FM chases SM. During FM's approach, he seems to quiver. I'm not sure what this is called.
At 12:22.37, FM swims into pot and quivers while inside. Not sure what this is called, as it lacks the abrupt turn of a lead swim and there is no obvious target.
At 13:01.03 FM backs up and tilts body in an unusual motion. Not sure what this is called.
At 14:04.87, FM tilts body and quivers, but the body seems straight so it doesn't seem like a quiver. Not sure what this is.
At 14:38.23, SM eye-bar is back
At 16:03.87 FM performs strange "flick" with body near the pot. Atheer suggests these kinds of motions I have been seeing might be fish rubbing against things, like scratching?
I am uncertain of the lead swim noted at 16:18.90
